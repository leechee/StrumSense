## – Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11 (via Anaconda/Miniconda)
- **No API keys needed!** ‰

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
cd StrumSense
```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create conda environment with Python 3.11:
```bash
conda create -n strumsense python=3.11 -y
```

4. Install Python audio analysis dependencies:
```bash
conda run -n strumsense pip install librosa numpy scipy
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

**Note**: The app uses the `strumsense` conda environment automatically for audio analysis.

## ¯ Usage

1. **Upload Audio**: Click or drag and drop your acoustic cover (MP3, WAV, M4A - max 10MB)
2. **Select Mood** (optional): Choose a mood like happy, sad, chill, romantic, etc.
3. **Get Recommendations**: Click "Get Recommendations" to analyze your playing
4. **View Results**: See your playing style analysis and personalized song recommendations

## § How It Works

### Audio Analysis Pipeline (100% Free!)

1. **Feature Extraction** (Python/librosa ML):
   - Tempo detection using beat tracking
   - Key and mode identification (major/minor)
   - Chroma features for chord detection
   - Spectral analysis (brightness, energy)
   - Playing style detection (fingerstyle vs strumming)
   - **Runs locally - no API calls!**

2. **Song Recognition** (Pattern Matching):
   - Analyzes audio features against known song patterns
   - Matches tempo ranges, keys, chords, and vibe
   - Generates confidence scores
   - **No GPT needed - completely free!**

3. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - Scores 30+ acoustic songs based on:
     - Tempo similarity (Â±10 BPM = highest score)
     - Key similarity (same key or related keys)
     - Chord overlap
     - Vibe/mood matching
     - Difficulty level
     - User preference history
   - Returns top 10 matches with detailed reasons

4. **User Profiling**:
   - Tracks upload history
   - Learns preferred keys, tempos, genres
   - Improves recommendations over time

##  Contributing

Want to add more song patterns? PRs welcome!

Each pattern is simple:
```javascript
{
  title: "Song Name",
  artist: "Artist",
  pattern: {
    tempo: [min, max],
    keys: ["G major"],
    chords: ["G", "C", "D"],
    vibe: ["upbeat", "bright"]
  }
}
```

## ¡ Tips for Best Results

- Upload 30-60 seconds of clear audio
- Play cleanly for better chord detection
- Try different moods for varied recommendations
- Upload multiple covers to build your profile

## ˜ Troubleshooting

### Python/Conda Issues
- Make sure conda environment `strumsense` exists
- Run: `conda create -n strumsense python=3.11 -y`
- Install libraries: `conda run -n strumsense pip install librosa numpy scipy`

### Audio Upload Fails
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Supported formats: MP3, WAV, M4A

### No Recommendations
- Check Python script is working: `conda run -n strumsense python scripts/audio_analyzer.py`
- Try demo mode: `/api/demo?style=slow_fingerstyle&mood=chill`
